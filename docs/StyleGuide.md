## Naming <a name="naming"></a>
Poorly-chosen names can mislead the reader and cause bugs. We cannot stress 
enough how important it is to use descriptive names. Pick names that match the 
semantics and role of the underlying entities, within reason. Avoid 
abbreviations unless they are well known (Do not abbreviate by deleting letters 
within a word). After picking a good name, make sure to use consistent 
capitalization for the name, as inconsistency requires clients to either 
memorize the APIs or to look it up to find the exact spelling. 

### Classes
Classes that are part of the main libary should use our modified UpperCamelCase 
style of "G4CMPFooBar"*.  One exception to this rule is when dealing with well 
known abbreviations, for example: ```class G4CMPLewinSmithNIEL```

Classes that are a not a part of the main libary, i.e. examples, tests, and 
validation, should use UpperCamelCase but not the "G4CMP" prefix as to not 
confuse new users.    

*_Very early utility classes, in particular the code that handles the config.txt 
files (like G4LatticeLogical, etc.), and the phonon particle types, have the 
plain "G4" prefix.  In fact, there are versions of those classes in the G4 
library.  If we change the names in G4CMP, then the G4 version will be "exposed" 
and confuse builds._

### Functions
Function names should be verb phrases (as they represent actions), and 
command-like functions should be imperative. The name should be UpperCamelCase 
(e.g. OpenFile() or IsFoo()).

### Common Variable Names
Variables (including function parameters) should be nouns (as they represent 
state). The name should be lowerCamelCase (e.g. version or tableName). 

One exception to this rule can be variables with limited use/scope of say a few 
lines. 

```cpp
void SetVerboseLevel(G4int vb) { verboseLevel = vb; } // vb is OK variable name here
```  

### Class Data Members
Generally, class data members should be named like common vaiables (above). New 
classes should follow this rule for class data members. 
```cpp
class TableInfo {
  ...
private:
  std::string tableName;  // Prefered for new code.
  static Pool<TableInfo>* pool;  // Prefered for new code.
};
```

The legacy nature of G4CMP complicates this.  Often in this code, class data 
members are prefixed with 'f', 'p', 'm', or 'k' to identify the type.  This 
"Hungarian" notation can be confusing and is highly out of favor in current 
coding statndards.  However while maintaing code written with such vaiables be 
consistent with what is used.  
```cpp
class TableInfo {
  ...
private:
  std::string fTableName;  // OK for legacy code.
  static Pool<TableInfo>* pPool;  // OK for legacy code.
};
```
_Note: In some of our code 'f' is used generically for class members reguardless 
of type.  This is another practice that can lead to confusing code.  Many style 
guides require trailing '\_' to identify class data member variables, but as 
this is not used anywhere in our current code base we choose not to do this._


## Class Files <a name="class"></a>
There should usually be one class per .cc file that follows the class naming 
convention above.

## Header Files <a name="headers"></a>
In general, every .cc file should have an associated .hh file. There are some 
common exceptions, such as unit tests or macros and small .cc files containing 
just a main() function.

Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability, size 
and performance of your code. 

The following rules will guide you through the various aspects of using header 
files.

### Self-contained Headers
Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in .hh. 
Non-header files that are meant for inclusion should end in .icc and be used 
sparingly.

The main use, and required use, of .icc files is with templated classes. 
Compilers (both GCC and LLVM/Clang) require that function implementations be 
provided in the .hh file of a templated class. The compiler uses that source to 
generate the template-argument implementations during compilation.

There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not self-contained. 
These are typically intended to be included at unusual locations, such as the 
middle of another file. They might not use header guards, and might not include 
their prerequisites. Name such files with the .icc extension. Use sparingly, and 
prefer self-contained headers when possible.

More about [inline functions](#inline) is discussed below.

### The #define Guard
All header files should have #define guards to prevent multiple inclusion.

```cpp
#ifndef G4CMPUtils_hh
#define G4CMPUtils_hh 1

...

#endif  /* G4CMPUtils_hh */
```

### Include Headers Judiciously
#include hurts compile time performance. Donâ€™t do it unless you have to, 
especially in header files.

If a source or header file refers to a symbol defined elsewhere, the file 
should directly include a header file which properly intends to provide a 
declaration or definition of that symbol. It should not include header files 
for any other reason.

- If the A.hh class definition uses an object of type B as a data member, or a 
pass-by-value function argument, then A.hh must have #include B.hh. In this 
case, the compiler needs to know the memory layout of B in order to determine 
the layout of A.
- If B is an enumerator (either a value or the typename), or a typedef rather 
than a defined class (the best example here is G4ThreeVector), then A.hh must 
have #include B.hh.
- Any other use of B, including pointers, pass-by-reference function arguments, 
and return values, should be forward declared.

However, you must include all of the header files that you are using. It is 
recommended not to rely on transitive inclusions. This allows people to remove 
no-longer-needed #include statements from their headers without breaking 
clients.

### Inline Functions <a name="inline"></a>

You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand them 
inline rather than calling them through the usual function call mechanism.

Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as the 
inlined function is small. Overuse of inlining can actually make 
programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code 
size to increase or decrease.

Except for very short code (e.g., one-line SetXYZ() functions), G4CMP does not 
have function implementations in the .hh file at all. Long implementations 
generally cannot be inlined anyway, so there's no point to having them in the 
.hh file.

One exception are the stream-output functions that call to a Print(std::ostream&) 
or Dump(std:ostream&) method; those are trivial enough that they can be inlined, 
and deserve to be.

## Order of Includes
Include headers in the following order: G4CMP headers, G4 headers, other 
libraries' headers (e.g. CLHEP), C system headers, C++ standard library headers, 
then your project's headers.

Don't include ```globals.hh```<a name="globnote"></a>.  It is usually included 
automatically with one of the low level Geant4 .hh files.  Occasionally, a .cc 
file might need "globals.hh", e.g., if it's a "standalone class" that only uses 
Geant4 data types or low-level objects like G4cout.

The prefered orders is:

1. The .hh file for the class
1. All the other G4CMP headers
1. G4 headers 
1. Other libraries' .hh files (e.g. CLHEP)
1. System headers (those with <...> notation)
1. ...with each group sorted alphabetically
1. Optional line breaks can be placed between groups

In MyFoo.cc, whose main purpose is to implement or test the stuff in 
G4CMPFoo2.hh, order your includes as follows:

With the preferred ordering, if the related header G4CMPFoo2.hh omits any 
necessary includes, the build of MyFoo.cc will break. Thus, this rule ensures 
that build breaks show up first for the people working on these files, not for 
innocent people in other packages.

Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note that 
older code might not conform to this rule and should be fixed when convenient.

For the above example, the includes might look like this:

```cpp
#include "G4CMPFoo2.hh"
#include "G4CMPBar.hh"
#include "G4Bar.hh"
#include "G4Foo.hh"

#include "CLHEP/Random/DoubConv.h"

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

#include "MyFoo.hh"
```

**Exception**:

Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code can put 
conditional includes after other includes. Of course, keep your system-specific 
code small and localized.  This should be very rare in our case.

Example:

```cpp
#include "foo/public/fooserver.h"

#include "base/port.h"  // For LANG_CXX11.

#ifdef LANG_CXX11
#include <initializer_list>
#endif  /* LANG_CXX11 */
```

Headers should only be included using an angle-bracketed path if the library 
requires you to do so. In particular, the following headers require angle 
brackets:

- C and C++ standard library headers (e.g. <stdlib.h> and \<string>).
- POSIX, Linux, and Windows system headers (e.g. <unistd.h> and <windows.h>).
- In rare cases, third_party libraries (e.g. <Python.h>).

Note that the C headers such as stddef.h are essentially interchangeable with 
their C++ counterparts (cstddef). Either style is acceptable, but prefer 
consistency with existing code.

## Formatting <a name="formatting"></a>

### Line Length
80 characters is the maximum.  

A line may exceed 80 characters if it is:

- A comment line which is not feasible to split without harming readability, 
ease of cut and paste or auto-linking -- e.g., if a line contains an example 
command or a literal URL longer than 80 characters.
- A string literal that cannot easily be wrapped at 80 columns. This may be 
because it contains URIs or other semantically-critical pieces, or because the 
literal contains an embedded language, or a multiline literal whose newlines are 
significant like help messages. In these cases, breaking up the literal would 
reduce readability, searchability, ability to click links, etc.  This should be 
very rare for our use case.

- An include statement
- A header guard
- A using-declaration

### Spaces vs. Tabs
Use only spaces, and indent 2 spaces at a time.

We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code. You should set your 
editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab key.

### Function Declarations and Definitions

Functions look like this:
```cpp
ReturnType ClassName::FunctionName(Type parName1, Type parName2) {
  DoSomething();
  ...
}
```

If you have too much text to fit on one line:
```cpp
ReturnType ClassName::ReallyLongFunctionName(Type parName1, Type parName2,
                                             Type parName3) {
  DoSomething();
  ...
}
```

or if you cannot fit even the first parameter:
```cpp
ReturnType LongClassName::
ReallyReallyReallyLongFunctionName(Type parName1, Type parName2, Type parName3) {
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent
  ...
}

ReturnType // Also ok, but prefer fewer lines
LongClassName::ReallyReallyReallyLongFunctionName(Type parName1, Type parName2,
                                                  Type parName3) {
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent
  ...
}
```
Some points to note:

- Choose good parameter names.
- A parameter name may be omitted only if the parameter is not used in the 
function's definition.
- If you cannot fit the return type and the function name on a single line, 
break between them or between the class and the method.  Optimize for 
readability.
- If you break after the return type or class of a function declaration or 
definition, do not indent.
- The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.
- There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.
- There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.
- The open curly brace is always on the end of the last line of the function 
declaration, not the start of the next line.
The close curly brace is either on the last line by itself or on the same line 
as the open curly brace.
- There should be a space between the close parenthesis and the open curly brace.
- All parameters should be aligned if possible.
- Default indentation is 2 spaces.
- Wrapped parameters have a 4 space indent.

### Floating-point Literals
Floating-point literals should always have a radix point, with digits on both 
sides, even if they use exponential notation. Readability is improved if all 
floating-point literals take this familiar form, as this helps ensure that they 
are not mistaken for integer literals, and that the E/e of the exponential 
notation is not mistaken for a hexadecimal digit. It is fine to initialize a 
floating-point variable with an integer literal (assuming the variable type can 
exactly represent that integer), but note that a number in exponential notation 
is never an integer literal.
```cpp
float foo = 1.0f;
float foo2 = 1.0;  // Also OK
float foo3 = 1;    // Also OK
long double bar = -0.5L;
double bar2 = 1248.0e6;
```

```cpp
// BAD EXAMPLES DON'T DO THIS!!!
float foo = 1.f;
long double bar = -.5L;
double bar2 = 1248e6;
```

### Function Calls
Either write the call all on a single line, wrap the arguments at the 
parenthesis, or start the arguments on a new line indented by four spaces and 
continue at that 4 space indent. In the absence of other considerations, use the 
minimum number of lines, including placing multiple arguments on each line where 
appropriate.

Function calls have the following format:
```cpp
bool result = DoSomething(argument1, argument2, argument3);
```

```cpp
bool result = DoSomething(aVeryVeryVeryVeryLongArgument1,
                          argument2, argument3);
```

```cpp
if (...) {
  ...
  ...
  if (...) {
    bool result = DoSomething(
        argument1, argument2,  // 4 space indent
        argument3, argument4);
    ...
  }
```
Put multiple arguments on a single line to reduce the number of lines necessary 
for calling a function unless there is a specific readability problem. Some find 
that formatting with strictly one argument on each line is more readable and 
simplifies editing of the arguments. However, we prioritize for the reader over 
the ease of editing arguments, and most readability problems are better 
addressed with the following techniques.

### Looping and branching statements
At a high level, looping or branching statements consist of the following 
components:

- One or more statement keywords (e.g. if, else, switch, while, do, or for).
- One condition or iteration specifier, inside parentheses.
- One or more controlled statements, or blocks of controlled statements.

For these statements:
- The components of the statement should be separated by single spaces (not line breaks).
- Inside the condition or iteration specifier, put one space (or a line break) 
between each semicolon and the next token, except if the token is a closing 
parenthesis or another semicolon.
- Inside the condition or iteration specifier, do not put a space after the 
opening parenthesis or before the closing parenthesis.
- Put any controlled statements inside blocks (i.e. use curly braces).
- Inside the controlled blocks, put one line break immediately after the opening 
brace, and one line break immediately before the closing brace.
```cpp
if (condition) {                   // Good - no spaces inside parentheses, space before brace.
  DoOneThing();                    // Good - two-space indent.
  DoAnotherThing();
} else if (int a = f(); a != 3) {  // Good - closing brace on new line, else on same line.
  DoAThirdThing(a);
} else {
  DoNothing();
}

// Good - the same rules apply to loops.
while (condition) {
  RepeatAThing();
}

// Good - the same rules apply to loops.
do {
  RepeatAThing();
} while (condition);

// Good - the same rules apply to loops.
for (int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
  RepeatAThing();
}
```

We allow one exception to the above rules: the line breaks inside the curly 
braces may be omitted if as a result the entire statement appears on a single 
line.
```cpp
// OK - fits on one line.
if (checkFoo == myFoo) { return new Foo(); }
```


### Pointer and Reference Expressions
No spaces around period or arrow. Pointer operators do not have trailing spaces.

The following are examples of correctly-formatted pointer and reference 
expressions:
```cpp
x = *p;
p = &x;
x = r.y;
x = r->y;
```

When referring to a pointer or reference (variable declarations or definitions, 
arguments, return types, template parameters, etc), you may place the space 
before or after the asterisk/ampersand. In the trailing-space style, the space 
is elided in some cases (template parameters, etc).
```cpp
// These are fine, space preceding.
char *myCharacters;
const std::string &myString;
int *GetPointer();
std::vector<char *>

// These are fine, space following (or elided).
char* myCharacters;
const std::string& myString;
int* GetPointer();
std::vector<char*>  // Note no space between '*' and '>'
```
You should do this consistently within a single file. When modifying an existing 
file, use the style in that file.


### Boolean Expressions
When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the standard line length, 
be consistent in how you break up the lines.

In this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end of the lines:
```cpp
if (thisOneThing > thisOtherThing &&
    aThirdThing == aFourthThing &&
    yetAnother && lastOne) {
  ...
}
```
Note that when the code wraps in this example, both of the && logical AND 
operators are at the end of the line. This is more common, though wrapping all 
operators at the beginning of the line is also allowed (This decision should be 
consistent within the file). 

Feel free to insert extra parentheses judiciously because they can be very 
helpful in increasing readability when used appropriately, but be careful about 
overuse. Also note that you should always use the punctuation operators, such as 
&& and ~, rather than the word operators, such as and and compl.

### Preprocessor Directives

The hash mark that starts a preprocessor directive should always be at the 
beginning of the line.

Even when preprocessor directives are within the body of indented code, the 
directives should start at the beginning of the line.  

```cpp
// Good - directives at beginning of line
  if (lopsidedScore) {
#if DISASTER_PENDING      // Correct -- Starts at beginning of line
    DropEverything();
# if NOTIFY               // OK but not required -- Spaces after #
    NotifyClient();
# endif
#endif
    BackToNormal();
  }
```

### Class Format

The basic format for a class definition is:
```cpp
class MyClass : public OtherClass {
public:      
  MyClass();  // 2 space indent.
  explicit MyClass(int var);
  ~MyClass() {}

  void SomeFunction();
  void SomeFunctionThatDoesNothing() {
  }

  void SetSomeVar(int var) { someVar = var; }
  int SomeVar() const { return someVar; }

private:
  bool SomeInternalFunction();

  int someVar;
  int someOtherVar;
};
```
Things to note:

- Any base class name should be on the same line as the subclass name, subject 
to the 80-column limit.
- The ```public:```, ```protected:```, and ```private:``` keywords should not be 
indented.
- Except for the first instance, these keywords should be preceded by a blank 
line. This rule is optional in small classes.
- Do not leave a blank line after these keywords.
- All of the member functions are declared first, in public, protected, private groups.
- Data members are declared at the bottom, again in public (rare, except for nearly pure container classes), protected and private order.

### Namespace Formatting
Namespaces should add an extra level (2 spaces) of indentation. For example, use:
```cpp
namespace {
  void Foo() {  // Correct.  No extra indentation within namespace.
    ...
  }
}  // namespace
```

### Horizontal Whitespace

#### general
```cpp
int i = 0;  // Two spaces before end-of-line comments.

void F(bool b) {  // Open braces should always have a space before them.
  ...
int i = 0;  // Semicolons usually have no space before them.
// Spaces inside braces for braced-init-list are optional.  If you use them,
// put them on both sides!
int x[] = { 0 };
int x[] = {0};

// Spaces around the colon in inheritance and initializer lists.
class Foo : public Bar {
public:
  // For inline function implementations, put spaces between the braces
  // and the implementation itself.
  Foo(int b) : Bar(), baz(b) {}  // No spaces inside empty braces.
  void Reset() { baz = 0; }  // Spaces separating braces from implementation.
  ...
```
#### loops and conditionals
```cpp
if (b) {          // Space after the keyword in conditions and loops.
} else {          // Spaces around else.
}
while (test) {}   // There is usually no space inside parentheses.
switch (i) {
for (int i=0; i<5; ++i) {
// Loops may have spaces inside parentheses when termination condition is 
// complicated but this is rare.
for ( int i = 0; i < getFoo(); ++i ) { // OK
  ...

// Range-based for loops always have a space before and after the colon.
for (auto x : counts) {
  ...
}
switch (i) {
  case 1:         // No space before colon in a switch case.
    ...
  case 2: break;  // Use a space after a colon if there's code after it.
```
#### operators
```cpp
// Assignment operators always have spaces around them.
x = 0;

// Other binary operators usually have spaces around them, but it's
// OK to remove spaces around factors.  Parentheses should have no
// internal padding.
v = w * x + y / z;
v = w*x + y/z;
v = w * (x + z);

// No spaces separating unary operators and their arguments.
x = -5;
++x;
if (x && !y)
  ...
```
#### templates and casts 
```cpp
// No spaces inside the angle brackets (< and >), before
// <, or between >( in a cast
std::vector<std::string> x;
y = static_cast<char*>(x);

// Spaces between type and pointer are OK, but be consistent.
std::vector<char *> x;

// Nested tempates MUST have spaces before > for proper syntax
std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<G4double> > > myVoxels;  // Spaces are required!
```

### Vertical Whitespace

The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the easier it is 
to follow and understand the control flow of the program. Use whitespace 
purposefully to provide separation in that flow.

Don't use blank lines when you don't have to. In particular, don't put more than 
one or two blank lines between functions, resist starting functions with a blank 
line, don't end functions with a blank line, and be sparing with your use of 
blank lines. A blank line within a block of code serves like a paragraph break 
in prose: visually separating two thoughts.

Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:

- Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function do not help readability.
- Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well help readability.
- A blank line before a comment line usually helps readability â€” the introduction 
of a new comment suggests the start of a new thought, and the blank line makes 
it clear that the comment goes with the following thing instead of the preceding.
- Blank lines immediately inside a declaration of a namespace or block of 
namespaces may help readability by visually separating the load-bearing content 
from the (largely non-semantic) organizational wrapper. Especially when the 
first declaration inside the namespace(s) is preceded by a comment, this becomes 
a special case of the previous rule, helping the comment to "attach" to the 
subsequent declaration.

## Comments <a name="comments"></a>
Comments are absolutely vital to keeping our code readable. The following rules 
describe what you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are 
very important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to 
types and variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then 
explain through comments.

When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next contributor who 
will need to understand your code. Be generous â€” the next one may be you!

### Comment Formatting
In general, prefer C++-style comments (// for normal comments, /// for doxygen 
documentation comments). 

There are a few cases when it is useful to use C-style (/* */) comments however:
- When documenting the significance of constants used as actual parameters in a 
call. This is most helpful for bool parameters, or passing 0 or nullptr. The 
comment should contain the parameter name, which ought to be meaningful. For 
example, itâ€™s not clear what the parameter means in this call:
   
   ```Object.emitName(nullptr);```

    An in-line C-style comment makes the intent obvious:

   ```Object.emitName(/*Prefix=*/nullptr);```
- When a function implementation does not (currently!) make use of an argument, 
it may be useful to show the argument name in the .cc file anyway, but commented 
out:
  ```cpp
  void G4CMPBoundaryUtils::DoSimpleKill(const G4Track& /*aTrack*/,
                                      const G4Step& /*aStep*/,
                                      G4ParticleChange& aParticleChange) {
  ...
  }
  ```
  We aren't using track or step in the current implementation, but we might in 
  the future (e.g., adding a diagnostic message with the track ID or something).
- Preprocessor lines can use C-style or C++-style comments.
- Our license statement uses C-style (see below).

Commenting out large blocks of code is discouraged, but if you really have to do 
this (for documentation purposes or as a suggestion for debug printing), use #if 
0 and #endif. These nest properly and are better behaved in general than C style 
comments.

Avoid using "flowery" ascii patterns. Below are a few examples of what not to do. 
```cpp
//*********************** // Bad
DoSomething();

//---------------------- // Bad
DoSomethingElse();

//////////////////////// // Bad
// my really important comment // OK if by itself 
/////////////////////// // Bad  
DoAnything();
```

### License
Each file should have the below license statement:
```cpp

 * License version 3 or later. See G4CMP/LICENSE for the full license. *

### Change tracking
While we use git to track changes in the code, a single commit may involve 
multiple files at once, and providing the details about each file is both 
onerous and error-prone. If a commit happens some time after a specific 
modification, the developer is more likely to forget to mention it.

Having the dated top comments in the file make it much easier to narrow down 
where something changed and might have caused a problem. We don't require a 
dated top comment for every commit; just at the time of development. Below is an 
example.

```cpp
// 20190704  Add selection of rate model by name, and material specific
```
It is still the responcibility of the developer to provide meaningful git commit 
messages and PR descriptions. 

Further information about change tracking can be found in the repository's 
CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Doxygen
Doxygen is a software package used to automate code documentation.  An 
introduction to the package is available here: 
[How to format source code.](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)

We would like to start making more use of Doxygen in our code base.  There are a 
lot of standards described below, and the more you comment your code 
the more usefull it will be.  We ask you to, at least, include file header 
comments described below, 

#### File Header Comments
At the top of every file, use the \file command to turn the standard file header 
into a file-level comment.  The main body is a Doxygen comment (identified by 
the /// comment marker instead of the usual //) describing the purpose of the 
file. The first sentence (or a passage beginning with \brief) is used as an abstract.
```cpp
/// \file library/include/G4CMPChargeCloud.hh
/// \brief Definition of the G4CMPChargeCloud class
///   Generates a collection of points distributed...
```

#### Inline Comments
Include descriptive paragraphs for all public interfaces (public classes, member 
and non-member functions). Avoid restating the information that can be inferred 
from the API name. Every non-trivial class should have a doxogen comment block 
that explains what the class is used for and how it works. 

To refer to parameter names inside a paragraph, use the \p name command. Donâ€™t 
use the \arg name command since it starts a new paragraph that contains 
documentation for the parameter.

Wrap non-inline code examples in \code ... \endcode.

To document a function parameter, start a new paragraph with the \param name 
command. If the parameter is used as an out or an in/out parameter, use the 
\param [out] name or \param [in,out] name command, respectively.

To describe function return value, start a new paragraph with the \returns command.

A minimal documentation comment:

```cpp
/// Sets the xyzzy property to \p Baz.
void SetXyzzy(bool Baz);
```

A documentation comment that uses all Doxygen features in a preferred way:
```cpp
/// Does foo and bar.
///
/// Does not do foo the usual way if \p baz is true.
///
/// Typical usage:
/// \code
///   FooBar(false, "quux", Res);
/// \endcode
///
/// \param quux kind of foo to do.
/// \param [out] result filled with bar sequence on foo success.
///
/// \returns true on success.
bool FooBar(bool baz, StringRef quux, std::vector<int> &result);
```
Donâ€™t duplicate the documentation comment in the header file and in the 
implementation file. Put the documentation comments for public APIs into the 
header file. Documentation comments for private APIs can go to the implementation 
file. In any case, implementation files can include additional comments (not 
necessarily in Doxygen markup) to explain implementation details as needed.

Donâ€™t duplicate function or class name at the beginning of the comment. For 
humans it is obvious which function or class is being documented; automatic 
documentation processing tools are smart enough to bind the comment to the 
correct declaration.

Avoid:

```cpp
// Example.h:

// Example - Does something important.
void Example();

// Example.cpp:

// Example - Does something important.
void Example() { ... }
```

Preferred:

```cpp
// Example.h:

/// Does something important.
void Example();

// Example.cpp:

/// Builds a B-tree in order to do foo.  See paper by...
void Example() { ... }
```


## Logging and Error Messages <a name="logging"></a>
_This section is very important and probably needs more work_

Every class should have a method (or virtual method) to pass the logging level 
onto your class.

For example:
```cpp
class G4CMPChargeCloud {
public:
  ...
  // Configure for logging
  void SetVerboseLevel(G4int vb) { verboseLevel = vb; }
  G4int GetVerboseLevel() const { return verboseLevel; }
  ...

protected:
  G4int verboseLevel;	// Diagnostic messages
  ...
```

There are 4 levels of verbosity:
- 0: No logging
- 1: High level logging
- 2: More detailed logging
- 3: Debuging information

For exammple:
```cpp
if (verboseLevel>2) { // Debug: i.e. verboseLevel = 3
  G4cout << " my debug statement " << importantVar << G4endl;
}
```

Error messages can be passed to the Geant4 error messaging with ```G4cerr``` 
which is included in ```globals.hh```. (See the note about ```globals.hh``` [above](#globnote)) 
```cpp
...
if (!TInvGood[itet]) {
  G4cerr << "ERROR: Non-invertible matrix " << itet << " with " << G4endl;
  for (G4int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    G4cerr << " " << tetra[i] << " @ " << X[tetra[i]] << G4endl;
  }
}
...
```

Exceptions should be emitted using G4Exception with an appropriate 
G4ExceptionSeverity argument. 
```cpp
#include "G4Exception.hh"
#include "G4ExceptionSeverity.hh"
...    
  if (!output.good()) {
      G4ExceptionDescription msg;
      msg << "Error opening output file " << fileName;
      G4Exception("PhononSensitivity::SetOutputFile", "PhonSense003",
                   FatalException, msg); // "FatalException" from G4ExceptionSeverity
      output.close();
  } else { ...
```

## Units  <a name="units"></a>
The native unit of Geant4 (and hence G4CMP) are mm, ns, and MeV.  Often times 
these are less convient for our development work.  

It is **required** to specify your units whenever you define a dimensionful 
constant, and to never specify units when performing computations with 
dimensionful variables. 

An important exception in G4CMP is when dealing with masses or momenta in 
true-mass units (MeV/c2 or kg). Geant4 treats energy, momentum, and mass all in 
energy units (MeV), so you will find places in the G4CMP code where a mass is 
divided by c^2 in order to implement functionality from condensed matter theory.

CLHEP units are available via ```G4SystemOfUnits.hh``` to explicitly define your 
units. 
```cpp
#include "G4SystemOfUnits.hh"

// unit examples
double fooMicrons = 100 * um;
double barCm = 200 * cm;
...
``` 

You can output the data on the unit you wish. To do so it is sufficient to 
DIVIDE the data by the corresponding unit:

```cpp     
G4cout << KineticEnergy/keV << " keV";
G4cout << density/(g/cm3)   << " g/cm3";
```
(Of course ```G4cout << KineticEnergy;``` will print the energy in the internal 
system of units)

There is another way to output the data which lets Geant4 chooses the most 
approriate unit to the actual numerical value of your data. It is sufficient to 
specify to which category your data belong (Length, Time, Energy, etc) for 
example:
```cpp
G4cout << G4BestUnit(StepSize, "Length");
```
StepSize will be printed in km, m, mm, or fermi depending of its actual value.

The unit category names can be printed with the UI command ```/units/list```, or 
by inspecting the Geant4 source code, G4UnitsTable.cc.

## Legacy Code (non-conformant code) <a name="legacycode"></a>

G4CMP was inially developed without the above guide.  While there was some effort 
to include the style decision of the orginal developers in this guide it is 
expected that portions of this code base are non-conformant.  

While maintaining this legacy code, try to touch as little of the code as 
possible.  Gratuitous changes to code in Git make it much harder to identify 
actual changes to the code when some bug needs to be tracked down. 

**When in doubt leave it alone!** 
 
However, a developer who wants to do a comprehensive style reformat should 
create a G4CMP JIRA ticket for that issue, keep the ticket up to date with what 
files are being touched, and make no other code changes that affect functionality.


## Notes <a name="notes"></a>
This guide was cherry-picked from the [Google C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) 
and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) style guides and much of 
it is copied directly so credit is given to them.  Effort was made to merge with 
the choices of the orginal developers where appropriate.
